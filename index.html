    <h2>How to convert an IP address to Binary</h2>
    <p>
        An IP address (32-bit) is divided into four octets. IP addresses are in dotted decimal, meaning that each octet (8 bits) is represented by a number between 0 and 255.
        So, the maximum binary number for an octet would be 11111111.For example, 255.255.255.255 converted to binary would be 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
    </p>
    <h3>But how would you do this?</h3>
    <p>First is to start with one decimal value like 127 in 127.0.0.1</p>
    
    <p>Decimal value: 127</p>
    <table style="width: 20%">
        
        <tr>
            <td>128</td>
            <td>64</td>
            <td>32</td>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
     In this conversion table, start with the number 128 and subtract it from your decimal number. If it doesn't fit,
     you leave the binary number 0 and go the next number. In this case, 64 can be subtracted from 127, making the binary number 1
     and leaving the decimal at 63. Next, 32 can subtract to 63, making the binary number 1 and leaving 31.
     You continue the process until your decimal value is 0.
    </p>

    <p>Decimal value: 127</p>
    <table style="width:20%">
        <tr>
            <td>128</td>
            <td>64</td>
            <td>32</td>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Continue the process with the next octet, which is the decimal value 0. In the end, 127.0.0.1 
        converted to binary would be 01111111.00000000.00000000.00000001
